Go Bindings for the lua C API

Simplest way to install:

$ goinstall -u github.com/xenith-studios/golua
$ cd $GOROOT/src/pkg/github.com/xenith-studios/golua
$ make install

Configuration Variables
-----------------------

In this version of the cgo bindings, I have removed the configuration variables
and instead force the build against a copy of the Lua-5.1.4 source that is
included in this distribution. This ensures that regardless of what changes you
make to your system Lua libraries, these bindings will continue to function.
