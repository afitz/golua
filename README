Go Bindings for the lua C API

Simplest way to install:

#go get -u github.com/aarzilli/golua/lua

Will work as long as pkg-config knows about lua.

You can then try to run the examples:

$cd /usr/local/go/src/pkg/github.com/aarzilli/golua/example/
$go run basic.go
$go run alloc.go
$go run panic.go
$go run userdata.go
